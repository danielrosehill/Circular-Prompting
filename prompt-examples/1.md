This project recently migrated its backend from Goose ORM to Drizzle.

We need to review the codebase to ensure that the updated backend and frontend functions are aligned. We should also ensure that the schema and indexes in the database are optimized for the purpose of this home inventory management application and resolve any remaining TypeScript errors in the project.

The objective is to bring this codebase to a stable position with a well-architected, effective, and performant data architecture.
